<!-- wht is react?
React is an open-source JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) for web and mobile apps

what is difference between framework and library?
The main difference between a framework and a library is the level of control the developer has over the application flow:

Frameworks and libraries are designed to be modular and reusable, meaning they can be used in multiple projects without needing to rewrite the code. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort and also help to improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.

What are libraries?
A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks. Libraries are often used to reduce the amount of code a programmer needs to write by providing reusable functions or classes that can be called upon as needed

What are Frameworks?
A framework is a set of libraries or tools that provide a structure for building applications. It typically includes code libraries, templates, and guidelines for how to use the libraries to develop applications.

What is a CDN(Content Delivery Network) used for?
CDNs help reliably and cost-effectively deliver rich and high-quality media files. Companies streaming video and audio use CDNs to overcome three challenges: reduce bandwidth costs, increase scale, and decrease delivery time. For example, Hulu is an online video streaming platform owned by the Walt Disney Company


what is react and reactDom?
While React provides the tools and concepts to define component-based user interfaces, ReactDOM handles the task of rendering those interfaces in a web environment.

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces using reusable components.

ReactDOM: A tool that renders React components into the actual web page (DOM) 

React is the core library for building UI components.
ReactDOM is the library that renders those React components into the browser's DOM.
They work together, but React is about UI logic and component structure, while ReactDOM is about rendering and interacting with the DOM in web applications.

Assignments
===========
why react is known as react
React is called "React" because of the way it handles reactive user interfaces.

 It "reacts" quickly to changes without reloading the whole page. It uses the virtual DOM to efficiently update parts of a webpage. It's built around components that "react" and update.

React is known as "React" because its core functionality revolves around being reactive to data and state changes. 

what is crossorigin
The purpose of crossorigin attribute is used to share the resources from one domain to another domain.

what is differencE between react.develoopment.js and react.production.js files via CDN?

Development Version (react.development.js): Used for development, includes debugging tools, error messages, and warnings to help developers. It is not optimized for performance and is not minified.

Production Version (react.production.js): Used in production, optimized for speed and size by removing all development-related code. It is minified for faster loading and improved performance.

In short, use the development version (react.development.js) while building and debugging your application, and switch to the production version (react.production.js) when deploying the app to users.

what is difference between async and defer?
Async
=====
Executes as soon as possible, in no particular order, and potentially before the HTML document is fully parsed. Async is a good choice for scripts that don't need to interact with the DOM, like scripts that load images or videos.

Defer
====
Executes after the HTML document is fully parsed, but before the DOMContentLoaded event. Defer is a good choice for scripts that need to interact with the DOM, like scripts that initialize widgets or add event listeners-->
