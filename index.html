what is difference between framework and library?
The main difference between a framework and a library is the level of control the developer has over the application flow:

Frameworks and libraries are designed to be modular and reusable, meaning they can be used in multiple projects without needing to rewrite the code. This can save developers a significant amount of time and effort and also help to improve the reliability and maintainability of the code.

What are libraries?
A library is a collection of pre-written code that you can use to perform specific tasks. Libraries are often used to reduce the amount of code a programmer needs to write by providing reusable functions or classes that can be called upon as needed

What are Frameworks?
A framework is a set of libraries or tools that provide a structure for building applications. It typically includes code libraries, templates, and guidelines for how to use the libraries to develop applications.

What is a CDN(Content Delivery Network) used for?
CDNs help reliably and cost-effectively deliver rich and high-quality media files.
